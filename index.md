# What is Ludigraphix ?

Ludigraphix is a geometry oriented vector drawing software. This means that shapes are defined by points that can be shared with other shapes. This allows you to build complex shapes that can be manipulated in a lot of different ways.

Drawings can be saved in a custom format and exported to svg or png files.

* Type of Shapes:
  - Circles (3 construction modes: by center-radius, by diameter, by 3 points on circle)
  - Ellipses (4 construction modes)
  - Squares (4 construction modes)
  - Rectangles (3 construction modes)
  - Polygon and polyline
  - Bezier curve and line
* 18 types of points: middle, symmetric, translated ...
* 11 Color effects: gradients, Perlin noise, inverse, hue rotation ...
* 6 Paths effets: Crenelate, Random moves, Truchet effect ...

# Documentation

## Quick start -- the basics

* Create a new document with the create button <img src="./icons/FileCreateDrawing@2x.png" class="icon">.
* Every icon inside a square <img src="./icons/EmptySquare@2x.png" class="icon"> is an "edition mode" icon. Only one edition mode can be activated at a time.
* To create an object, select one of the edition mode icons : various types of shapes and points can be created in each mode.
* There are three modes that are not used for creating object: 
  - "Select and Move" <img src="./icons/SelectAndMove@2x.png" class="icon"> &rArr; default edition mode.
  - "Move all" <img src="./icons/MoveAll@2x.png" class="icon"> &rArr; move the drawing and hide points.
  - "Merge into point" <img src="./icons/MergeIntoPoint@2x.png" class="icon"> &rArr; used to merge a point with another point.
* Use "Select and Move" <img src="./icons/SelectAndMove@2x.png" class="icon"> mode to move objects and edit objects properties.
  - Path effects and color effects can be added and modified in the property panel.
* Previous created points can be reused for new shapes, that is the easiest way to link shapes together.
* When creating a point, a currently existing point can be replaced by clicking on it at last creation step.
